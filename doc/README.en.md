## Use Cases

### Case 1: Multi-device Work
When switching between office and home work environments, there's no need to manually record and reopen tabs. After saving your workspace at the office, you can restore all tabs with one click at home and continue working seamlessly.

### Case 2: Project Archiving
During project development, you often need to save reference materials for different stages. Use TabSyncer to create independent snapshots for each project and add project names for easy future reference and recovery.

### Case 3: Temporary Storage
When browsing design inspiration or collecting materials, you might need to close the browser suddenly. Use TabSyncer to save all current tabs, and restore them with one click next time without losing any important information.

### Case 4: Material Integration
When collecting materials, you might save different snapshots multiple times. Use the merge feature to combine multiple snapshots into a complete collection for unified management and use.
